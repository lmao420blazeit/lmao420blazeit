### Hi ðŸ˜„

- I'm currently working on building my github repos with some projects I've been building over the years so I can easily show my interests and skills. Hopefully I can contribute to your projects as well!
- I'm currently learning:
  -  workflow managers such as prefect and perfecting airflow
  -  transitioning from pandas to dask and high performance computing
  -  mysql to pl sql/oracle
